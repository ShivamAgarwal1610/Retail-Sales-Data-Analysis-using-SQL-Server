## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Retail Sales Data Analysis** using **SQL Server**.  
It demonstrates how SQL queries can be used to uncover insights such as:
- Total and average sales  
- Top customers  
- Best-selling months  
- Category-wise performance  
- Time-based sales segmentation (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)  

The analysis is performed using raw transactional data from a CSV file and aims to support business decision-making through data-driven insights.
